  ### What happened?
  I attempted to configure [Split DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS) using two ingress-nginx controllers: one for internal requests and another for those coming over Cloudflare IPs. To cut a long story short, I severely misconfigured my pi-hole, OpenWrt, and Cilium settings.

  ### What did I learn?
  One genius guy explaining it very well and convincing me that I absolutely need it does not necessarily mean that I need it right now.

  Keep it simple! Use WireGuard over OCI until I decide to make anything publicly available.
